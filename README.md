## Overview

This repository contains a project that implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes Machine Learning model to classify the text language from images. The model is trained on a dataset of newspaper snippets written in three different languages: English, Hindi, and Punjabi. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to showcase how to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then use a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the language of the extracted text.
